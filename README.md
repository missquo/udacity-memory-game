## Introduction

This is a basic card matching game that tracks the player's moves and time, then allots a rating based on how many moves the player takes to complete the game.  It is Project #2 in [Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).  They provided some initial HTML and CSS, and students are required to make it functional and encouraged to make the design their own from there.  This is my initial take on the project.  The game is operational on all major browsers, including those on Apple and Android mobile devices.

## Try It Yourself
